This is a significant temperature threshold used in medical contexts.

If measured <strong>rectally</strong>, 37.5°C (99.5°F) is usually considered normal (borderline). However, if measured <strong>under the arm (axillary)</strong>, 37.5°C can be equivalent to a core temperature of roughly 38°C (100.4°F), which IS significant. For newborns, infants, and <strong>young children</strong>, you should monitor them closely and consult a pediatrician if unsure."},{"question":"37.5 C to F under arm (Axillary)?","answer":"37.5°C is <strong>99.5°F</strong>. When taking an axillary (underarm) temperature, medical guidelines often suggest adding about 0.5°C to 1°C (or 1°F to 2°F) to get an estimated core body temperature. So an underarm reading of 37.5°C could mean a core temp of ~38°C (100.4°F)."},{"question":"What is 37.5 Celsius in Kelvin?","answer":"37.5 degrees Celsius is equal to <strong>310.65 Kelvin</strong>."}]},"warning":{"title":"Medical Note for Babies","content":"For infants under 3 months, any temperature above 38°C (100.4°F) rectally is a medical emergency. 37.5°C is close to this threshold.
