To convert, use the formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32. So 75 × 1.8 + 32 = {fahrenheit}°F."},{"question":"Is 75°C hot?","answer":"Yes, 75°C ({fahrenheit}°F) is extremely hot for human comfort. It\'s much hotter than normal body temperature and can cause burns upon contact. However, it\'s a useful temperature for various cooking and industrial applications."},{"question":"What is 75°C in oven terms?","answer":"75°C is considered a moderate to hot oven temperature. It\'s suitable for baking cookies, cakes, roasting vegetables, and cooking casseroles. Many recipes specify oven temperatures around 70-80°C for slow roasting or gentle baking."},{"question":"How to convert 75°C to Fahrenheit easily?","answer":"You can use the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32. For quick mental calculations, you can approximate by doubling the Celsius value and adding 30. For 75°C, doubling gives 150, plus 30 gives 180, which is close to the exact value of {fahrenheit}°F."},{"question":"Is 75°C dangerous?","answer":"Yes, 75°C is dangerous for direct human contact and can cause immediate burns. It requires proper handling and safety precautions. Always use appropriate protective equipment when working with temperatures at this level."},{"question":"What does 75°C feel like?","answer":"75°C feels extremely hot and will cause immediate pain and burns upon contact with skin. It\'s much hotter than hot tap water (which is typically regulated to below 50°C for safety reasons)."},{"question":"What is the difference between 75°C and 75°F?","answer":"There\'s a significant difference. 75°C is {fahrenheit}°F, which is much hotter than 75°F (which equals approximately 23.9°C). 75°C is hot enough to cause burns, while 75°F is a comfortable room temperature."}]}}');
