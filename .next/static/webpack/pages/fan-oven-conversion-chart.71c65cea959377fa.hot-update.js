Oven Thermometer is Essential","text":"Most ovens run hot or cold. For precision baking, place an independent oven thermometer in the center of your oven to verify actual temperature."},{"title":"2. Adjust Baking Times","text":"As a general rule, reduce baking times by 10-15% when using fan mode. Start checking for doneness earlier than recipe suggests."},{"title":"3. Rack Position Matters","text":"Middle rack works best for most baking. For multiple racks, rotate pans halfway through baking for even results."},{"title":"4. Avoid Overcrowding","text":"Fan ovens need good air circulation. Leave at least 2 inches between pans and avoid covering oven racks with foil."},{"title":"5. Humidity Control","text":"Fan ovens can dry foods faster. For moist cakes, place a pan of water in the bottom of the oven during baking."},{"title":"6. High Altitude Adjustments","text":"At elevations above 900m (3000ft), you may need additional temperature reductions of 5-10°C in fan ovens."},{"title":"7. Account for Brand Variations","text":"Every oven brand has a slightly different fan speed. If your fan oven is particularly powerful (like some professional models), you may need to reduce the temperature by 25°C instead of the standard 20°C."},{"title":"8.

Set to 180°C fan and let preheat for 20 minutes. Check thermometer reading through the window. If it\'s more than 10°C different, you may need to adjust your settings."},{"question":"Should I reduce both temperature and time?","answer":"Yes, for most recipes you should reduce temperature by 20°C (from conventional to fan) and reduce time by 10-15% (start checking early)."},{"question":"Are all fan ovens the same?","answer":"While the 20°C rule works for most fan ovens, there can be variations. Standard fan ovens typically need -20°C adjustment, while multi-function/combi ovens may need -10 to -30°C adjustments."},{"question":"What is 425°F in a fan oven?","answer":"425°F converts to approximately 220°C in a conventional oven. For a fan oven, reduce by 20°C to get 200°C."},{"question":"How to convert gas mark to fan oven?","answer":"Use our conversion chart above.
