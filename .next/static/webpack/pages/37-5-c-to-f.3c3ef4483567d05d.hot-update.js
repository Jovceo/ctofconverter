This mental math is useful for everyday approximations."},{"question":"At what temperature are Celsius and Fahrenheit equal?","answer":"Celsius and Fahrenheit intersect at -40. In other words, -40°C equals -40°F. This is the point where both scales show the same numeric value."},{"question":"Is Celsius temperature bad for you?","answer":"Celsius is simply a measurement unit. What matters is the actual temperature. For instance, 37°C is normal body temperature, while 60°C on skin can cause burns."}]}}');
