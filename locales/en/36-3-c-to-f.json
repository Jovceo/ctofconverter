        "q2": {
            "question": "Is 36.3°C a fever for babies and children?",
            "answer": "No, 36.3°C ({fahrenheit}°F) is not a fever for babies or children. It's within the normal range. A fever is typically considered to be 38°C (100.4°F) or higher in children."
        },
        "q3": {
            "question": "What does 36.3°C under the arm mean?",
            "answer": "36.3°C ({fahrenheit}°F) measured under the arm (axillary) indicates a normal body temperature. Axillary temperatures typically read 0.5-1°C lower than core body temperature, so this reading suggests your actual core temperature is perfectly normal."
        },
        "q4": {
            "question": "Is 36.3°C too low for a newborn?",
            "answer": "36.3°C ({fahrenheit}°F) is within the normal range for newborns and is generally acceptable. However, newborns have less temperature regulation ability, so temperatures below 36°C (96.8°F) should be evaluated by a healthcare provider."
        },
        "q5": {
            "question": "How do I convert 36.3°C to Fahrenheit?",
            "answer": "To convert 36.3°C to Fahrenheit: Multiply 36.3 by 9/5 (or 1.8) = 65.34; Add 32 to the result: 65.34 + 32 = 97.34; Final answer: 36.3°C = 97.34°F. This is a normal body temperature."
        },
        "q6": {
            "question": "When should I worry about 36.3°C temperature?",
            "answer": "You generally don't need to worry about 36.3°C ({fahrenheit}°F) itself, as it's normal. However, seek medical advice if accompanied by concerning symptoms like lethargy, difficulty breathing, poor feeding (in babies), or if temperature rapidly drops below 35.5°C."
