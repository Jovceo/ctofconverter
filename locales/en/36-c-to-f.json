        "q2": {
            "question": "Is 36°C too low for adults?",
            "answer": "36°C (96.8°F) is NOT too low for most adults. It's within the normal range, though on the lower end. Hypothermia concerns typically arise below 35.0°C (95°F). However, if your temperature is consistently below 35.5°C or you feel unwell, consult a healthcare provider."

            "question": "What does 36°C mean for a baby?",
            "answer": "36°C (96.8°F) is a normal temperature for babies. Infants often have temperatures between 36.0-37.5°C. Newborns have less temperature regulation, so monitor patterns rather than single readings. Contact a pediatrician if consistently below 35.8°C or above 37.5°C, or if baby shows signs of illness."
        },
        "q4": {
            "question": "Why is my temperature 36°C in the morning?",
            "answer": "Morning temperatures are typically 0.3-0.5°C lower than afternoon/evening due to circadian rhythms. 36°C in the morning is completely normal. Body temperature naturally fluctuates throughout the day, being lowest around 6 AM and highest around 4-6 PM."
        },
        "q5": {
            "question": "Should I be concerned about 36°C temperature?",
            "answer": "36°C (96.8°F) alone is not a cause for concern. Worry signs include: Temperature consistently below 35.5°C; Sudden drop from your normal baseline; Accompanied by symptoms like shivering, confusion, or fatigue; In babies: poor feeding, lethargy, or cold extremities. Otherwise, 36°C is a healthy temperature."
        },
        "q6": {
            "question": "How do I convert 36°C to Fahrenheit?",
            "answer": "To convert 36°C to Fahrenheit: Multiply 36 by 9/5 (or 1.8) = 64.8; Add 32 to the result: 64.8 + 32 = 96.8; Final answer: 36°C = 96.8°F. This is a normal body temperature within healthy range."
