            "question": "Is 100°C a fever temperature?",
            "answer": "No, 100°C (212°F) is not a human body temperature. There's often confusion with 100°F (37.8°C), which is a slightly elevated body temperature. Normal body temperature is around 37°C. Exposure to 100°C temperatures would cause severe burns and is incompatible with human survival."

            "question": "What is 100°C in Kelvin?",
            "answer": "100°C equals 373.15 Kelvin (K). The conversion formula is K = °C + 273.15."

        "item5": {
            "question": "How does altitude affect the boiling point of water?",
            "answer": "Boiling point decreases with altitude due to lower pressure. At sea level, water boils at 100°C (212°F). At 3,000 meters, it boils at only 90°C (194°F). This requires adjustments for cooking and baking at high elevations."

        "item6": {
            "question": "What is 100°F in Celsius?",
            "answer": "100°F equals 37.78°C. This is calculated using the formula: °C = (100 - 32) × 5/9."
