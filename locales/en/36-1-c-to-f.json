            "question": "Is 36.1°C a fever for babies and children?",
            "answer": "No, 36.1°C ({fahrenheit}°F) is not a fever for babies or children. It's actually at the lower end of normal range. A fever is typically considered to be 38°C (100.4°F) or higher in children."

        "q3": {
            "question": "What does 36.1°C under the arm mean?",
            "answer": "36.1°C ({fahrenheit}°F) measured under the arm (axillary) indicates a normal body temperature. Axillary temperatures typically read 0.5-1°C lower than core body temperature, so this reading suggests your actual core temperature is perfectly normal."
        },
        "q4": {
            "question": "Is 36.1°C too low for a newborn?",
            "answer": "36.1°C ({fahrenheit}°F) is at the lower end of normal for newborns but generally acceptable. However, newborns have less temperature regulation ability, so temperatures below 36°C (96.8°F) should be evaluated by a healthcare provider."
        },
        "q5": {
            "question": "What is 36.1 Celsius in Fahrenheit fever?",
            "answer": "36.1°C ({fahrenheit}°F) is not a fever. This is a common search misunderstanding. If you're concerned about fever, you might be looking for information around 38°C (100.4°F) or higher, which is the fever threshold."
        },
        "q6": {
            "question": "When should I worry about 36.1°C temperature?",
            "answer": "You generally don't need to worry about 36.1°C ({fahrenheit}°F) itself, as it's normal. However, seek medical advice if accompanied by concerning symptoms like lethargy, difficulty breathing, poor feeding (in babies), or if temperature rapidly changes."
