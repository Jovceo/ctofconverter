This threshold is used by healthcare professionals to determine when body temperature is elevated enough to be considered febrile. Note: This applies to oral measurements. Rectal fever threshold is 38.3°C (101°F), and underarm is 37.5°C (99.5°F)."
        },
        "q2": {
            "question": "Is 38°C dangerous for adults?",
            "answer": "For most healthy adults, 38°C (100.4°F) is NOT dangerous. It's actually your immune system working effectively. Seek medical care if: Fever exceeds 39.4°C (103°F); Persists >3 days; Accompanied by severe headache, stiff neck, shortness of breath, chest pain, or confusion; You have compromised immunity or chronic conditions."
        },
        "q3": {
            "question": "What does 38°C mean for a baby?",
            "answer": "38°C (100.4°F) in babies requires age-based response: Newborns 0-3 months: EMERGENCY - seek immediate care; Infants 3-6 months: URGENT - contact pediatrician same day; Babies 6+ months: Monitor closely, contact doctor if persists >24 hours. Always use rectal thermometers for accuracy in infants."
        },
        "q4": {
            "question": "Is 38°C under the arm different from oral?",
            "answer": "Yes! Underarm (axillary) temperatures read 0.5°C (0.9°F) lower than oral. If you measure 38°C under the arm, your actual core temperature is approximately 38.5°C (101.3°F) - already in moderate fever range. Medical thresholds are based on oral measurements, so add 0.5°C to underarm readings for accuracy."
        },
        "q5": {
            "question": "When should I worry about a 38°C fever?",
            "answer": "38°C (100.4°F) itself is usually not worrisome, but watch for: Infants <3 months: Any 38°C+ is emergency; Children: Fever >48 hours or lethargy; Adults: Fever >3 days or severe symptoms; Anyone: Stiff neck, severe headache, breathing difficulty, chest pain, confusion, or rash. How the person looks/acts matters more than the number."
        },
        "q6": {
            "question": "When should I take fever-reducing medication?",
            "answer": "Take antipyretics when: Adults: Temperature >38.5°C (101.3°F) OR significant discomfort; Children: Temperature >38.5°C (101.3°F) AND child is uncomfortable; Never give aspirin to children. Common options: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil). Remember: Treat the person, not just the number - a comfortable child with 38.5°C fever may not need medication."
