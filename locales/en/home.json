        "question": "What is the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit?",
        "answer": "Celsius and Fahrenheit are two different temperature scales. Celsius is widely used internationally, while Fahrenheit is common in the United States. They have different zero and boiling points: water freezes at 0°C / 32°F and boils at 100°C / 212°F."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I quickly estimate the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit?",
        "answer": "A quick estimation trick is Celsius × 2 + 30 ≈ Fahrenheit. For example, 20°C ≈ (20 × 2) + 30 = 70°F (actual 68°F). This mental math is useful for everyday approximations."
      },
      {
        "question": "At what temperature are Celsius and Fahrenheit equal?",
        "answer": "Celsius and Fahrenheit intersect at -40. In other words, -40°C equals -40°F. This is the point where both scales show the same numeric value."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Celsius temperature bad for you?",
        "answer": "Celsius is simply a measurement unit. What matters is the actual temperature. For instance, 37°C is normal body temperature, while 60°C on skin can cause burns."
