        "q2": {
            "question": "Is 36.4°C too low for adults?",
            "answer": "36.4°C (97.5°F) is NOT too low for adults. It's well within the normal range. Hypothermia concerns typically arise below 35.0°C (95°F). 36.4°C is a healthy mid-range temperature that many adults naturally have."

            "answer": "36.4°C (97.5°F) is a normal temperature for babies. Infants often have temperatures between 36.0-37.5°C. Newborns have less temperature regulation, so monitor patterns rather than single readings. Contact a pediatrician if consistently below 35.8°C or above 37.5°C, or if baby shows signs of illness."

        "q4": {
            "question": "Why is my temperature 36.4°C in the morning?",
            "answer": "Morning temperatures are typically 0.3-0.5°C lower than afternoon/evening due to circadian rhythms. 36.4°C in the morning is completely normal and healthy. Body temperature naturally fluctuates throughout the day, being lowest around 6 AM and highest around 4-6 PM."
        },
        "q5": {
            "question": "Should I be concerned about 36.4°C temperature?",
            "answer": "36.4°C (97.5°F) alone is not a cause for concern. Worry signs include: Temperature consistently below 35.5°C; Sudden drop from your normal baseline; Accompanied by symptoms like shivering, confusion, or fatigue; In babies: poor feeding, lethargy, or cold extremities. Otherwise, 36.4°C is a healthy temperature."
        },
        "q6": {
            "question": "How do I convert 36.4°C to Fahrenheit?",
            "answer": "To convert 36.4°C to Fahrenheit: Multiply 36.4 by 9/5 (or 1.8) = 65.52; Add 32 to the result: 65.52 + 32 = 97.52; Final answer: 36.4°C = 97.5°F. This is a normal body temperature within healthy range."
