The 37°C (98.6°F) 'standard' is outdated. Modern normal range is 36.4°C to 36.6°C (97.5°F to 97.9°F). Your temperature is perfectly healthy."
        },
        "q2": {
            "question": "Why have body temperatures dropped since the 1800s?",
            "answer": "Stanford researchers identified three factors: 1) Better health and lower inflammation due to medical advances; 2) Reduced metabolic rate from modern sedentary lifestyles; 3) Climate-controlled environments reducing body workload. 36.4°C reflects these improvements, not a problem."

            "question": "What did the Stanford body temperature study find?",
            "answer": "The 2020 Stanford study analyzed 677,423 temperature measurements from 1892-2017. Key findings: Men's temps dropped 0.59°C, women's 0.32°C. Average temps decreased 0.03°C per birth decade. The 37°C (98.6°F) standard from 1868 is no longer accurate for modern populations. 36.4°C-36.6°C is the new normal."
        },
        "q4": {
            "question": "Is 36.4°C normal for babies and children?",
            "answer": "Yes. Children show the same temperature decline as adults in Stanford's research. 36.4°C (97.5°F) is a healthy temperature for all ages. Pediatricians now recognize broader normal ranges. Contact doctors only for consistent readings below 35.5°C or accompanying illness symptoms."
        },
        "q5": {
            "question": "Should I trust modern 36.4°C standards or old 37°C?",
            "answer": "Trust modern research. The 37°C (98.6°F) standard comes from a single 1868 German study of 25,000 people. Modern Stanford research (2020) uses 677,000+ measurements. Medical institutions including Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins now accept 36.4°C-36.6°C as the updated normal range. 36.4°C is medically sound."
        },
        "q6": {
            "question": "How do I convert 36.4°C to Fahrenheit correctly?",
            "answer": "To convert 36.4°C to Fahrenheit: Multiply 36.4 by 9/5 (or 1.8) = 65.52; Add 32 to the result: 65.52 + 32 = 97.52; Rounded: 36.4°C = 97.5°F. This temperature represents the modern average lower limit according to 2020 Stanford Medical research."
