WHO and medical institutions define normal range as 36.5-37.5°C. 36.5°C represents optimal physiological function where enzymes, immune cells, and metabolic processes work most efficiently. It's the gold standard benchmark."

            "question": "Why is 36.5°C used as the medical standard for normal temperature?",
            "answer": "Medical institutions use 36.5°C (97.7°F) as the standard because: 1) It represents optimal enzyme function for digestion; 2) Immune cells are most active at this temperature; 3) Cardiovascular system maintains ideal blood flow; 4) Brain function is sharp; 5) Hormone production is balanced.

            "answer": "Yes, 36.5°C (97.7°F) is normal for all ages. WHO guidelines state normal body temperature is 36.5-37.5°C for everyone. For babies, it indicates good thermoregulation. For children, it supports growth and activity. For adults, it represents optimal immune and metabolic function. This is the universal medical standard."

            "question": "What's the difference between 36.4°C and 36.5°C?",
            "answer": "36.4°C (97.5°F) represents the lower limit of modern average body temperature according to recent Stanford research. 36.5°C (97.7°F) is the traditional medical standard used by WHO and hospitals worldwide. Both are normal, but 36.5°C has been the clinical benchmark for medical assessment for decades."

        "q5": {
            "question": "Should I be worried if my temperature isn't exactly 36.5°C?",
            "answer": "No. Normal body temperature ranges from 36.0°C to 37.5°C (96.8°F to 99.5°F). 36.5°C is the standard benchmark, but anywhere in the normal range is healthy. Individual baseline varies by 0.3-0.5°C. Worry only if consistently below 35.5°C or above 37.8°C, or if accompanied by illness symptoms."

        "q6": {
            "question": "How do I convert 36.5°C to Fahrenheit accurately?",
            "answer": "To convert 36.5°C to Fahrenheit: Multiply 36.5 by 9/5 (or 1.8) = 65.7; Add 32 to the result: 65.7 + 32 = 97.7; Final answer: 36.5°C = 97.7°F. This represents the standard normal body temperature used in medical guidelines and hospitals worldwide."
